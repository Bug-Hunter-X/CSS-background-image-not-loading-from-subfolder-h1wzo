# CSS background-image not loading from subfolder

This repository demonstrates a common issue where a CSS `background-image` rule fails to load an image from a subfolder.  The image path appears correct, yet the image does not display.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, and `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

This issue highlights the importance of correctly specifying relative paths in CSS when working with images located in subdirectories.
